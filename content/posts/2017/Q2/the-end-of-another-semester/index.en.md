<!-- Love Story - The Piano Guys -->

Ah, there are still ten days to get rid of the city and return to that reassuring mountain
forest, waiting and anxious, wondering why the remaining ten days are so difficult.

The final review is a mess again. I am really lazy...

It is so unrealistic for me to have such a big dream that I have finished thousands of
lines of code. I kind of want to accept my fate.

After one o'clock in the middle of the night, I was still not used to the air conditioner
in the bedroom, but the cool breeze on the aisle balcony is very comfortable, and the
serenity of the city now also has a bit of charm.

But anyway, I really want to go home.
