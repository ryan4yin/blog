## About This Blog

>"For me, blog is first of all a knowledge management tool, followed by a communication tool. My technical articles are mainly used to sort out the knowledge I don't understand yet. I only write about things that I haven't fully mastered yet. As for the things I am proficient in, I usually have no incentive to write related articles. Showing off has never been my motivation to write. Curiosity is."  ──阮一峰
