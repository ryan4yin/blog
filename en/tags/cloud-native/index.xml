    <a href="#preface" class="header-mark"></a>Preface</h2><p>I had known for a while that KubeCon China would be held in Hong Kong this year, and while
I was interested, I initially got deterred by the steep price of KubeCon tickets.</p>
<p>Sometimes you just have to believe in the magic of luck. By a twist of fate, I learned
about KubeCon&rsquo;s &lsquo;End User Ticket Program&rsquo; from my friend @Kev and snagged a ticket for
free. I also invited three friends from the <a href="https://0xffff.one/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">0xFFFF Community</a>,<a href="https://0xffff.one/u/Chever-John" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Chever-John</a>,<a href="https://0xffff.one/u/0xdeadbeef" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@0xdeadbeef</a>, and<a href="https://0xffff.one/u/MingLLuo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MingLLuo</a>, to join in. We rented an Airbnb in Hong Kong,
explored quite a few places in the city, and had a fruitful trip.</p>

  <p>I also tried to invite other friends and colleagues, but they couldn&rsquo;t make it for
various reasons, which was a bit of a bummer.</p>
