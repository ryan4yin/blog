            </div><p>I have dabbled with many niche technologies, and this year, the main ones I explored are
NixOS, window manager i3/hyprland, and Neovim. NixOS, in particular, took me to a whole
new level - I even created an open-source bilingual book<a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-and-flakes-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nixos-and-flakes-book</a> to help
beginners get started. Additionally, I worked on several NixOS-related open-source
projects like <a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nix-darwin-kickstarter</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ryan4yin/nix-config</a>, which all received
positive feedback.</p>
<p>Based on my experiences with these niche technologies and the frequent questions I receive
(e.g., why did I choose <a href="nixos.org/" rel="">NixOS</a> / <a href="https://github.com/Neovim/Neovim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neovim</a> /<a href="https://flypy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flypy Chinese Input Method</a>? What are their advantages? Can they
really improve productivity?), I would like to briefly share my thoughts on them.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
