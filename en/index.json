Why NixI heard about the Nix package manager several years ago. It uses the Nix language to describe system configuration, and the Linux distribution build on top of it can roll back to any historical state at any time. Although it sounds impressive, it requires learning a new language and writing code to install packages, I thought it was too troublesome and didn’t study it at the time. But recently I encountered two troublesome things when migrating the system, which made me decide to try Nix. The fist problem was installing EndeavourOS (a derivative distribution of Arch Linux) on a newly assembled PC. Because My old PC also uses EndeavourOS, I directly rsync the old PC’s Home directory to the new PC to save time after installation. However, this synchronization caused a problem. All functions worked normally, but video playback always stuck. Firefox, Chrome, and MPV would all get stuck. I searched various resources online but could not solve the problem until I realized it might be caused by the Home directory synchronization. After clearing the Home directory, the problem was solved immediately… Later, I spent a long time recovering things from the old PC one by one. The second problem is that I recently wanted to try Wayland, so I changed the desktop from i3wm to sway. However, because there was little difference between the two and many inconveniences (hidpi, Sway configuration tuning, etc.), I decided to switch back to i3wm. After switching back, GUI programs such as Firefox and Thunar would always get stuck for about a minute after the system started… I was too tired to deal with the second problem, after thinking about it carefully, I realized that the root cause was that the system did not have any version control and rollback mechanism, which caused the system to be unable to be restored when problems occurred. And another problem, when installing a new system, I had to manually export the package list from the old machine and then install them on the new machine. So I decided to switch to NixOS. The first step I took was to create a NixOS virtual machine in my Homelab, and debug step by step in this virtual machine to migrate my old PC’s EndeavourOS i3 configuration to NixOS + Flakes and restore the entire desktop environment. Once I had it working on the virtual machine, the rest was easy. I simply backed up my Home directory and software list from my work computer, reinstalled the system as NixOS, git cloned my debugged NixOS configuration, made some adjustments to the disk mounting parameters and added some extra NixOS configurations for my Nvidia graphics card. Finally, with just a few commands, I deployed the configuration and was able to restore the entire i3 desktop environment and my commonly used software on my fresh NixOS system. It was a truly satisfying moment! The rollback capability of NixOS gave me a lot of confidence - I no longer fear breaking the system. So a few days ago, I further migrated to the hyprland desktop, which is indeed much better than i3, and I love its animation effects! (On EndeavourOS before, I wouldn’t have dared to make such a switch for the reasons mentioned earlier - it would have been a big hassle if something went wrong with the system.) Note: some friends on V2EX gave feedback that btrfs’s snapshot feature can also provide similar rollback capabilities, and it is much simpler. After some research, I found that to be true. btrfs can even be configured to boot from a snapshot using GRUB(just like the NixOS does). So if you only want the system rollback capability, then btrfs based snapshot tools(e.g. btrbk) is also a good choice. Or if you’re still interested in Nix, It is definitely worth learning, as Nix’s capabilities are far beyond just system snapshots. My NixOS Desktop So after studying NixOS and Nix Flakes for about half a month, I finally completed my system switch, and this article is born out of the notes I wrote during this period of time, hope you like it~ Now","date":"2023-05-10","objectID":"/en/posts/nixos-and-flake-basics/:1:0","series":null,"tags":["NixOS","Nix","Flakes","Linux","DevOps"],"title":"NixOS \u0026 Nix Flakes - A Guide for Beginners","uri":"/en/posts/nixos-and-flake-basics/#0-why-nix"},{"categories":["tech"],"content":" I. Introduction to NixNix package manager is a declarative configuration management tool similar to pulumi/terraform/kubernetes that are currently popular in the DevOps field. Users need to declare the expected system state in some configurations, and Nix is responsible for achieving that goal. The difference is that Nix manages software packages, while pulumi/terraform manages cloud resources. To put it simply, “declarative configuration” means that users only need to declare the results they want. For example, you declares that you want to replace the i3 window manager with sway, then Nix will help you achieve the goal. You don’t need to worry about the underlying details (such as which packages sway needs to install, which i3-related packages need to be uninstalled, which system configurations or environment variables need to be adjusted for sway, what adjustments need to be made to the Sway parameters if an Nvidia graphics card is used, etc.), Nix will automatically handle these details for the user(prerequisite: if the sway’s nix packages are designed properly…). The Linux distribution built on top of the Nix package manager, NixOS, can be simply described as “OS as Code”, which describes the entire operating system’s state using declarative Nix configuration files. NixOS’s configuration only manages the system-level state, the user’s HOME directory is not under its control. Another important community project, home-manager, filled this gap, home-manager is designed to managing user-level’s packages \u0026 HOME directories. By combining home-manager with NixOS and Git, a fully reproducible and rollbackable system environment can be obtained(ideally). Due to Nix’s declarative and reproducible features, Nix is not only used to manage desktop environments but also widely used to manage development and compilation environments, cloud virtual machines, and container image construction. NixOps from the Nix official and deploy-rs from the community are both operations tools based on Nix. Since there are numerous files in the home directory with varying behaviors, it is impossible to version control all of them due to the high cost. Generally, only some important configuration files are managed using home-manager, and other files that need to be backed up can be backed up and synchronized using rsync/synthing, or use tools like btrbk to take snapshots of the home directory.

As long as the configuration files are not lost, the system can be restored to any historical state at any time(ideally). Nix lock dependent library versions through a lock file named flake.lock, to ensure that the system is reproducible, this idea actually borrows from some package managers such as npm, cargo, etc. Compared with Docker, Nix provides a much stronger guarantee for the reproducibility of build results, because Dockerfile is actually an imperative configuration and there is no such thing as flake.nix in Docker, Docker’s reproducibility relys on share the build result(which is MUCH MORE LARGAR than Dockerfile itself) through image regitry(e.g. DockerHub). Highly convenient system customization capability By changing a few lines of configuration, various components of the NixOS system can be easily customized. This is because Nix encapsulates all the underlying complex operations in nix packages and only exports concise and necessary declarative parameters. Moreover, this modification is very safe. An example is that one NixOS user on the V2EX forum have stated that “on NixOS, switching between different desktop environments is very simple and clean, and it is very safe. I often switch between gnome/kde/sway.” Rollback: The system can be rolled back to any historical environment at any time, and NixOS even adds all old versions to the boot options by default to ensure that the system can be rolled back at any time even though it crashes. Therefore, NixOS is also considered one of the most stable Linux Systems. No dependency conflicts: Because each software package in Nix has a unique hash, its installation path also includes this hash value, so multiple versions can coexist. The community is very active, and there are quite a few third-party projects. The official package repository, nixpkgs, has many contributors, and many people share their Nix configurations on Github/Gitlab. After browsing through it, the entire ecosystem gives me a sense of excitement in discovering a new continent. All historical versions are listed in the boot options of NixOS.

You cannot blindly use nix-env -i (which is similar to apt-get install). Chaotic documentation: Firstly, Nix Flakes is still an experimental feature, and there are currently relatively few documents introducing it. Secondly, most of the Nix community’s documentation only introduces the old nix-env/nix-channel. If you want to start learning Nix directly from Nix Flakes, you need to refer to a large number of old documents and extract what you need from them. In addition, some of Nix’s current core functions are not well-documented (such as imports and Nixpkgs Module System), so it is best to look at the source code to understand them. Relatively few packages: Retract this one. The official claim is that nixpkgs has 80000+ packages, and indeed, most packages can be found in nixpkgs. Relatively high disk space usage: To ensure that the system can be rolled back at any time, Nix preserves all historical environments by default, which can take up a lot of disk space. Although you can manually clean up old historical environments periodically with nix-collect-garbage, it is still recommended to buy a larger hard drive.

Nix Flakes and the old NixIn 2020, Nix introduced two new features, nix-command and flakes, which provide new command-line tools, standard Nix package structure definitions, and flake.lock version lock files similar to cargo/npm. These two features greatly enhance the capabilities of Nix. Although they are still experimental features as of 2023-05-05, they have been widely used by the Nix community and are strongly recommended. Currently, most of the Nix community’s documentation still only covers traditional Nix and does not include Nix Flakes-related content. However, from the perspective of reproducibility and ease of management and maintenance, the old Nix package structure and command-line tools are no longer recommended for use. Therefore, this document will not introduce the usage of the old Nix package structure and command-line tools, and it is recommended that beginners ignore these old contents and just start with nix-command \u0026 flakes. Here are the old Nix command-line tools and related concepts that are no longer needed in nix-command and flakes. When searching for information, you can safely ignore them: nix-channel: nix-channel is similar to other package management tools such as apt/yum/pacman, managing software package versions through stable/unstable/test channels. In Nix Flakes, the functionality of nix-channel is completely replaced by inputs in flake.nix to declare dependency sources and flake.lock to lock dependency versions. nix-env: nix-env is a core command-line tool for traditional Nix used to manage software packages in the user environment. It installs software packages from the data sources defined by nix-channel, so the installed package versions are influenced by the channel. Packages installed with nix-env are not automatically recorded in Nix’s declarative configuration and are entirely outside of its control, making them difficult to reproduce on other machines. Therefore, it is not recommended to use this tool. The corresponding command in Nix Flakes is nix profile. nix-shell: nix-shell is used to create a temporary shell environment. In Nix Flakes, it is replaced by nix develop and nix shell. nix-build: nix-build is used to build Nix packages, and it places the build results in the /nix/store path, but it does not record them in Nix’s declarative configuration. The corresponding command in Nix Flakes is nix build. … maybe nix-env -qa is still useful some times, which returns all packages installed in the System.

Managing the system declaratively https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overview_of_the_NixOS_Linux_distribution After learning the basics of the Nix language, we can start using it to configure the NixOS system. The system configuration file for NixOS is located at /etc/nixos/configuration.nix, which contains all the declarative configurations for the system, such as time zone, language, keyboard layout, network, users, file system, boot options, etc. If we want to modify the system state in a reproducible way (which is also the most recommended way), we need to manually edit the /etc/nixos/configuration.nix file, and then execute sudo nixos-rebuild switch to apply the configuration. This command generates a new system environment based on the configuration file, sets the new environment as the default one, and also preserves \u0026 added the previous environment into the grub boot options. This ensures we can always roll back to the old environment(even if the new environment fails to start). On the other hand, /etc/nixos/configuration.nix is the traditional Nix configuration method, which relies on data sources configured by nix-channel and has no version locking mechanism, making it difficult to ensure the reproducibility of the system. A better approach is to use Nix Flakes, which can ensure the reproducibility of the system and make it easy to manage the configuration. Now first, let’s learn how to manage the system using the default configuration method of NixOS through /etc/nixos/configuration.nix, and then transition to the more advanced Nix Flakes.

It relies on data sources configured by nix-channel and has no version locking mechanism, making it difficult to ensure the reproducibility of the system. For example, to enable ssh and add a user “ryan,” simply add the following configuration to /etc/nixos/configuration.nix: # Edit this configuration file to define what should be installed on # your system. Help is available in the configuration.nix(5) man page # and in the NixOS manual (accessible by running ‘nixos-help’). { config, pkgs, ... }: { imports = [ # Include the results of the hardware scan. ./hardware-configuration.nix ]; # Omit the previous configuration....... # add user ryan users.users.ryan = { isNormalUser = true; description = \"ryan\"; extraGroups = [ \"networkmanager\" \"wheel\" ]; openssh.authorizedKeys.keys = [ # replace with your own public key \"ssh-ed25519 \u003csome-public-key\u003e ryan@ryan-pc\" ]; packages = with pkgs; [ firefox # thunderbird ]; }; # enable openssh-server services.openssh = { enable = true; permitRootLogin = \"no\"; # disable root login passwordAuthentication = false; # disable password login openFirewall = true; forwardX11 = true; # enable X11 forwarding }; # omit the rest of the configuration....... } in the configuration above, we enabled the openssh service, added an ssh public key for the user ryan, and disabled password login.

See # the Home Manager release notes for a list of state version # changes in each release. home.stateVersion = \"22.11\"; # Let Home Manager install and manage itself. programs.home-manager.enable = true; } After adding /etc/nixos/home.nix, you need to import this new configuration file in /etc/nixos/flake.nix to make it effective, use the following command to generate an example /etc/nixos/flake.nix in the current folder for reference: nix flake new -t github:nix-community/home-manager#nixos After adjusting the parameters, the content of /etc/nixos/flake.nix is as follows: { description = \"NixOS configuration\"; inputs = { nixpkgs.url = \"github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable\"; home-manager.url = \"github:nix-community/home-manager\"; home-manager.inputs.nixpkgs.follows = \"nixpkgs\"; }; outputs = inputs@{ nixpkgs, home-manager, ... }: { nixosConfigurations = { # please change the hostname to your own nixos-test = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem { system = \"x86_64-linux\"; modules = [ ./configuration.nix # make home-manager as a module of nixos # so that home-manager configuration will be deployed automatically when executing `nixos-rebuild switch` home-manager.nixosModules.home-manager { home-manager.useGlobalPkgs = true; home-manager.useUserPackages = true; # replace ryan with your own username home-manager.users.ryan = import ./home.nix; # Optionally, use home-manager.extraSpecialArgs to pass # arguments to home.nix } ]; }; }; }; } Then execute sudo nixos-rebuild switch to apply the configuration, and home-manager will be installed automatically. After the installation is complete, all user-level programs and configurations can be managed through /etc/nixos/home.nix, and when executing sudo nixos-rebuild switch, the configuration of home-manager will be applied automatically.

Modular NixOS configurationAt this point, the skeleton of the entire system is basically configured. The current system configuration structure in /etc/nixos should be as follows: $ tree . ├── flake.lock ├── flake.nix ├── home.nix └── configuration.nix The functions of these four files are explained below: flake.lock: An automatically generated version lock file, which records all input data sources, hash values, and version numbers of the entire flake to ensure that the system is reproducible. flake.nix: The entry file, which will be recognized and deployed when executing sudo nixos-rebuild switch. See Flakes - NixOS Wiki for all options of flake.nix. configuration.nix: Imported as a Nix module in flake.nix, all system-level configurations are currently written in this file. See Configuration - NixOS Manual for all options of configuration.nix. home.nix: Imported by home-manager as the configuration of the user ryan in flake.nix, that is, it contains all the Home Manager configurations of ryan, and is responsible for managing ryan’s Home folder. See Appendix A. Configuration Options - Home Manager for all options of home.nix. By modifying the above configuration files, you can change the status of the system and the Home directory declaratively. As the configuration increases, it is difficult to maintain the configuration files by relying solely on configuration.nix and home.nix. Therefore, a better solution is to use the module mechanism of Nix to split the configuration files into multiple modules and write them in a classified manner. imports parameter can accept a list of .nix files, and merge all the configurations in the list into the current attribute set. Note that the word used here is “merge”, which means that imports will NOT simply overwrite the duplicate configuration items, but handle them more reasonably. For example, if I define program.packages = [...] in multiple modules, then imports will merge all program.packages in all modules into one list. Not only lists can be merged correctly, but attribute sets can also be merged correctly. The specific behavior can be explored by yourself. I only found a description of imports in nixpkgs-unstable official manual - evalModules parameters: A list of modules. These are merged together to form the final configuration., you can try to understand it… With the help of the imports parameter, we can split home.nix and configuration.nix into multiple .nix files. For example, the structure of my previous i3wm system configuration ryan4yin/nix-config/v0.0.2 is as follows: ├── flake.lock ├── flake.nix ├── home │ ├── default.nix # here we import all submodules by imports = [...] │ ├── fcitx5 # fcitx5 input method's configuration │ │ ├── default.nix │ │ └── rime-data-flypy │ ├── i3 # i3 window manager's configuration │ │ ├── config │ │ ├── default.nix │ │ ├── i3blocks.conf │ │ ├── keybindings │ │ └── scripts │ ├── programs │ │ ├── browsers.nix │ │ ├── common.nix │ │ ├── default.nix # here we import all modules in programs folder by imports = [...] │ │ ├── git.nix │ │ ├── media.nix │ │ ├── vscode.nix │ │ └── xdg.nix │ ├── rofi # rofi launcher's configuration │ │ ├── configs │ │ │ ├── arc_dark_colors.rasi │ │ │ ├── arc_dark_transparent_colors.rasi │ │ │ ├── power-profiles.rasi │ │ │ ├── powermenu.rasi │ │ │ ├── rofidmenu.rasi │ │ │ └── rofikeyhint.rasi │ │ └── default.nix │ └── shell # shell/terminal related configuration │ ├── common.nix │ ├── default.nix │ ├── nushell │ │ ├── config.nu │ │ ├── default.nix │ │ └── env.nu │ ├── starship.nix │ └── terminals.nix ├── hosts │ ├── msi-rtx4090 # My main machine's configuration │ │ ├── default.nix # This is the old configuration.nix, but most of the content has been split out to modules. │ │ └── hardware-configuration.nix # hardware \u0026 disk related configuration, autogenerated by nixos │ └── nixos-test # my test machine's configuration │ ├── default.nix │ └── hardware-configuration.nix ├── modules # some common NixOS modules that can b","date":"2023-05-10","objectID":"/en/posts/nixos-and-flake-basics/:7:6","series":null,"tags":["NixOS","Nix","Flakes","Linux","DevOps"],"title":"NixOS \u0026 Nix Flakes - A Guide for Beginners","uri":"/en/posts/nixos-and-flake-basics/#6-modular-nixos-configuration"},{"categories":["tech"],"content":" 7.

Rollback the version of some packagesAfter using Nix Flakes, most people are currently using the nixos-unstable branch of nixpkgs. Sometimes you will encounter some bugs, such as the chrome/vscode crash problem To resolve this problem, we need to rollback the version of some packages. In Nix Flakes, all package versions and hash values are one-to-one corresponding to the git commit of their input data source. Therefore, to rollback a package to a historical version, we need to lock the git commit of its input data source. So to rollback the version of some packages, first modify /etc/nixos/flake.nix, the example content is as follows (mainly using the specialArgs parameter): { description = \"NixOS configuration of Ryan Yin\" inputs = { # default to nixos-unstable branch nixpkgs.url = \"github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-unstable\"; # the latest stable branch of nixpkgs, used to rollback the version of some packages # the current latest version is 22.11 nixpkgs-stable.url = \"github:nixos/nixpkgs/nixos-22.11\"; # we can also use git commit hash to lock the version nixpkgs-fd40cef8d.url = \"github:nixos/nixpkgs/fd40cef8d797670e203a27a91e4b8e6decf0b90c\"; outputs = inputs@{ self, nixpkgs, nixpkgs-stable, nixpkgs-fd40cef8d, ... }: { nixosConfigurations = { nixos-test = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem { system = \"x86_64-linux\"; # The core parameter, which passes the non-default nixpkgs data source to other modules specialArgs = { inherit nixpkgs-stable; inherit nixpkgs-fd40cef8d; }; modules = [ ./hosts/nixos-test # omit other configurations... ]; }; }; }; } And then refer the packages from nix-stable or nixpkgs-fd40cef8d in your corresponding sub module, a home manager’s sub module as an example: { pkgs, config, # nix will search and jnject this parameter from specialArgs in flake.nix nixpkgs-stable, # nixpkgs-fd40cef8d, ... }: let # To use packages from nixpkgs-stable, we need to configure some parameters for it first pkgs-stable = import nixpkgs-stable { # The Global parameters will be automatically configured to the default pkgs, so we can directly refer to them from pkgs system = pkgs.system; # To use chrome, we need to allow the installation of non-free software config.allowUnfree = true; }; in { # refer packages from pkgs-stable instead of pkgs home.packages = with pkgs-stable; [ firefox-wayland # chrome wayland support was broken on nixos-unstable branch, so fallback to stable branch for now # https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/7562 google-chrome ]; programs.vscode = { enable = true; package = pkgs-stable.vscode; # refer vscode from pkgs-stable instead of pkgs }; } After adjusted the configuration, deploy it with sudo nixos-rebuild switch, then your firefox/chrome/vscode will revert to the version corresponding to nix-stable or nixpkgs-fd40cef8d.

Manage NixOS configuration with GitNixOS’s configuration file is plain text, so it can be managed with Git just like ordinary dotfiles. On the other hand, flake.nix do not required to be placed in the /etc/nixos directory, they can be placed in any directory, as long as the correct path is specified during deployment. For example, my usage is to place the Nix Flakes configuration in the ~/nixos-config directory, and then create a soft link in the /etc/nixos directory: sudo mv /etc/nixos /etc/nixos.bak # backup the original configuration sudo ln -s ~/nixos-config/ /etc/nixos # deploy the flake.nix located at the default location(/etc/nixos) sudo nixos-rebuild switch And then you can use Git to manage the configuration in the ~/nixos-config directory. The configuration can be used with ordinary user-level permissions, and it is not required to be owned by root. Another method is to delete /etc/nixos directly, and specify the configuration file path each time you deploy: sudo mv /etc/nixos /etc/nixos.bak cd ~/nixos-config # deploy the flake.nix located in the current directory sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .

Nixpkgs’s Advanced UsagecallPackage, Overriding, and Overlays are the techniques occasionally used when using Nix to customize the build method of Nix packages. We know that many programs have a large number of build parameters that need to be configured, and different users may want to use different build parameters. This is where Overriding and Overlays come in handy. Let me give you a few examples I have encountered: fcitx5-rime.nix: By default, rimeDataPkgs for fcitx5-rime uses the rime-data package, but this parameter can be customized using override to load custom rime configurations (such as loading the Xiaohe keyboard input method configuration). vscode/with-extensions.nix: This package for VS Code can also be customized by overriding the value of the vscodeExtensions parameter to install custom plugins. nix-vscode-extensions: This is a vscode plugin manager implemented using this parameter. firefox/common.nix: Firefox also has many customizable parameters. … In short, in order to customize the build parameters of Nix packages of this type, we need to use Overriding or Overlays.

Overriding - nixpkgs Manual Simply put, all Nix packages in nixpkgs can be customized with \u003cpkg\u003e.override {} to define some build parameters, which returns a new Derivation that uses custom parameters. For example: pkgs.fcitx5-rime.override {rimeDataPkgs = [ ./rime-data-flypy ];} The result of executing the above Nix expression is a new Derivation, where the rimeDataPkgs parameter is overridden as [./rime-data-flypy], while other parameters retain their original values. In addition to overriding parameters, you can also override the attributes of a Derivation(condiftion: it’s built using stdenv.mkDerivation) by using overrideAttrs. For example: helloWithDebug = pkgs.hello.overrideAttrs (finalAttrs: previousAttrs: { separateDebugInfo = true; }); In this example, helloWithDebug is a new Derivation, where the separateDebugInfo parameter is overridden as true, while other parameters retain their original values.

It is of great significance that I have changed from being careful at the beginning to becoming a veteran now. Using python to write several Kubernetes management platform services, this is also my first time to write online services, quite a sense of achievement In the second half of the year, I spent a lot of energy on the analysis and control of AWS cost, and got some good results, which benefited a lot. Learned the simple use of Nginx, just enough to maintain the company’s pre-existing Nginx proxy configuration. Lead the completion of “create a new K8s cluster and migrate the services to the new cluster”. Although it is not a very difficult thing, but this should be my greatest achievement in 2021. I also encountered all kinds of problems in the process of upgrading. When I first upgraded and migrated, I prepared for a long time and panicked. As a result, there was still something wrong with some of the services during the upgrade. I was really confused at that time. Casually wrote a few demo of Go, and made little progress. Learning the rust language for a week, quickly finished reading The Book, and rewrote a video2chars in rust Learned the underlying principle of Linux container: cgroups/namespace technology, and implemented a demo with go/rust Learned various network interfaces and iptables of Linux Be familiar with PromQL/Grafana If I give myself a score, it’s “good”. Because I am not very enterprising, so the result can not be called “excellent”. By the way, the new office of Mobiuspace is really great.

Thinking about whether to continue to invest in Istio or to switch to other options. Service Mesh is still evolving rapidly, and the future trend should be eBPF + Envoy + WASM. Cilium’s eBPF-based Service Mesh is a new trend (it falls back to Per-Node Proxy mode when using advanced features). It’s expected to hit other Service Mesh of Sidecar mode in terms of cost and delay. As for the log of K8s cluster, we currently use a self-developed system based on gelf protocol, but there are a lot of problems. From the point of view of improving the maintainability and ease of use of the log system, loki is worth exploring. In terms of K8s cluster management, I think the upgrade iteration of the cluster can be done more automatically and reliably. Next year, we can explore more in the direction of multi-cluster management. Pod Service Quality: For non-core services, the amount of requests resources can be appropriately reduced instead of fully reserved (Guaranteed) to improve resource utilization. The official HPA capability is not enough. Our developers needs to scale the services based on QPS/Queue or other parameters. We should continue to promote the landing of KEDA. In terms of cost control, I realized the benefits of ARM architecture and AWS Spot EC2. There is a lot of potential room for optimization of cross-area traffic cost.
