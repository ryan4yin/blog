NixOS, in particular, took me to a whole new level - I even created an open-source bilingual book nixos-and-flakes-book to help beginners get started. Additionally, I worked on several NixOS-related open-source projects like nix-darwin-kickstarter and ryan4yin/nix-config, which all received positive feedback. Based on my experiences with these niche technologies and the frequent questions I receive (e.g., why did I choose NixOS / Neovim / Flypy Chinese Input Method? What are their advantages? Can they really improve productivity?), I would like to briefly share my thoughts on them.

Niche technologies are those with a relatively smaller user base within their respective domains. According to this definition, I can list some niche technologies I have encountered in different fields: Domain Niche Technologies Mainstream Technologies Text Editors Neovim, Emacs VSCode, Pycharm, IDEA Keyboard Layout Dvorak QWERTY Linux Distros NixOS, Gentoo, Arch Linux Ubuntu, Fedora Window Managers i3, hyprland KDE, GNOME Most people tend to choose mainstream technologies in these fields due to their lower learning curve and ease of use. I was once part of the majority, but I gradually discovered the advantages of niche technologies, which led me to try and eventually transition to them.

Based on my personal experience with these niche technologies, they share some notable common characteristics. Firstly, they have a common downside: higher learning curve and more time required to get familiar with them during the initial stages. This filters out the majority of users, and only those who enjoy tinkering and embracing challenges will be willing to explore these niche technologies. For instance, with the Dvorak keyboard layout, the learning curve is steep, requiring a significant amount of time to memorize the key arrangement and practice, leading to a challenging input experience in the early stages. To achieve the typing speed you had with the QWERTY keyboard layout, you might need to practice Dvorak for at least an hour a day consistently for a month. Now, let’s discuss their common advantages: High customizability: Users can freely customize various functions according to their needs. Strong sense of control and excellent user experience: The high level of customization gives users a sense of complete control while using these technologies, resulting in an excellent user experience. High user retention and active communities: Users continuously explore, learn, and customize these technologies, creating a strong sense of belonging within the communities. Due to these reasons, once users successfully familiarize themselves with a niche technology (e.g., dvorak keyboard layout, Neovim/Emacs editors), it becomes challenging for them to revert to the previous mainstream solutions. They will find the previous solutions less convenient and enjoyable.

However, what makes me stick with them is their excellent user experience. For instance, with Neovim editor and Hyprland window manager, once configured, they are aesthetically pleasing! Moreover, Neovim is exceptionally fast, even too fast! This speed may not impress those VSCode / IDEA users who haven’t experienced Neovim before, but once you get used to it, you’ll find the speed truly impressive, just like the character Tu Hengyu exclaims in the The Wandering Earth 2 (550W is too fast! This speed is too fast!). Additionally, after mastering these technologies, I find them enjoyable to use. The keyboard-driven interaction provides a sense of control and smoothness(elegant, so elegant!). My NixOS + Hyprland Desktop My Neovim Editor Similarly, my love for NixOS is based on similar reasons. NixOS with its declarative, reproducible (consistent runtime environment), OS as Code features aligns perfectly with what an Site Reliablility Engineer like me desires. I couldn’t wait to use it and even wanted to improve it promptly to make it suitable for more scenarios. A few days ago, I saw a comment from a foreign netizen on 4chan (although the language was a bit extreme, I still somewhat agreed…): Completely and utterly unacceptable. Imagine having a tool that can’t even properly undo an operation and then relying on it to manage an operating system. apt, pip, pm, rpm, pacman, whatever are all a mad fucking joke.

In fact, many of these tools or technologies can be time-consuming distractions, driven by one’s interests to continuously explore their boundaries and adjust configurations to better suit individual needs. During the initial phase, the time invested in these endeavors often outweighs the saved time from increased productivity. So, ultimately, trying to use these technologies to significantly boost productivity is not realistic. They can improve your efficiency, but to a limited extent, unless your typing speed is the limiting factor in your productivity, emmm… Or some may argue that once you become completely proficient, vim/emacs makes it easier to enter a state of flow? That is also difficult to say.

Why do you always delve into these things that are useless for the business? (teasing tone) However, compared to doing something boring for leisure, there are some useful takeaways. For instance, when I encounter a bug in AstroNvim , I provide a PR to the upstream repository. When I find that NixOS documentation is inadequate, I write my own documentation and share it. If I notice that NixOS lacks support for a SBC I have, I might try to port it. And if I find that a certain tool lacks a feature I want, I might just write one myself. The experiences gained, open-source projects created, PRs left in upstream repositories, and the appreciation received in the community all feel valuable. It may not necessarily have business value, but it’s fun, and you get to make friends, help others, and leave your mark in the open-source community - isn’t that interesting?

I talked a lot with @是格子啊, @Cheese and former colleagues). Thank you very much for helping me sort out my thoughts and giving me an affirmation. At the same time, I was recommended by @Cheese and started using twitter. I climbed the mountain every day to see the scenery, bought a hammock to take a nap in the park, practiced the harmonica and bamboo flute, and played like this for a month. In March, I started looking for a job. After meeting with several companies, I was very lucky to enter Mobiuspace and became a new SRE. The experience of a year in Mobiuspace is written in the “work” section, which is skipped here. At the end of March, I watched the movie “Raya and The Last Dragon” (the only movie I watched in 2021), and the ending song was very good. In April, by various coincidences, I unexpectedly found that my junior high school classmate’s residence was less than one kilometer away from me. I had a meal of hometown food and bayberry wine at his house. It tasted very good! In August, my two cousin came to Shenzhen for a summer internship. I crossed Shenzhen’s east-west coastline with them. The scenery was great, but we were really hot and thirsty on the way. In October Joined Mobiuspace’s surfing team, surfing and have a seaside barbecue for the first time. Bought roller skates, learned reverse skating and step steering, and reviewed some basic skills learned in college. In December, Bought a YunMi RO Filterred Water Dispenser, and many kinds of tea.

The writing is very real and the feelings are very delicate. At the end of the year, my second grandfather died. After attending the funeral, I vaguely found some profound changes in my mind.

I felt like I was out of luck. After all, Mobiuspace, whether it is the level of colleagues or the working atmosphere, or the number of customers, compared with my last company is qualitatively different. My first station in Mobiuspace After getting familiar with the contents and methods of the work, leader tried his best to give me the work that best matched my interests, helping me solve problems, and at the same time giving me great autonomy, which was really great. However, a high degree of autonomy also brings higher difficulty in work. I have been in a hurry, confused, and even self-doubted when I encounter difficulties. I am worried about whether I will run away the next day. But fortunately, I still have the ability to adjust my mindset, take responsibility and finish the work step by step. When there were several delays in my work, leader accompanied me to work overtime. After the work was done, he took me to a big dinner to reward myself. I really thanked him for his help and support. My new station, near the floor-to-ceiling window, the view is great. Looking back at the summary and outlook for 2020, I find that the actual progress this year is very different from what I expected last year. The initial goal was only about 10% achieved, but because I was exposed to a lot of unexpected things, I was generally satisfied: It is a great gain to be familiar with the culture and working style of the new company - Mobiuspace, and my working style has been greatly improved. Contact and be familiar with Mobiuspace’s AWS online environment Responsible for maintaining the online Kubernetes management platform, the first time I came into contact with the online cluster peak QPS was tens of thousands. It is of great significance that I have changed from being careful at the beginning to becoming a veteran now. Using python to write several Kubernetes management platform services, this is also my first time to write online services, quite a sense of achievement In the second half of the year, I spent a lot of energy on the analysis and control of AWS cost, and got some good results, which benefited a lot. Learned the simple use of Nginx, just enough to maintain the company’s pre-existing Nginx proxy configuration. Lead the completion of “create a new K8s cluster and migrate the services to the new cluster”. Although it is not a very difficult thing, but this should be my greatest achievement in 2021. I also encountered all kinds of problems in the process of upgrading. When I first upgraded and migrated, I prepared for a long time and panicked. As a result, there was still something wrong with some of the services during the upgrade. I was really confused at that time. Casually wrote a few demo of Go, and made little progress. Learning the rust language for a week, quickly finished reading The Book, and rewrote a video2chars in rust Learned the underlying principle of Linux container: cgroups/namespace technology, and implemented a demo with go/rust Learned various network interfaces and iptables of Linux Be familiar with PromQL/Grafana If I give myself a score, it’s “good”. Because I am not very enterprising, so the result can not be called “excellent”. By the way, the new office of Mobiuspace is really great.

Thinking about whether to continue to invest in Istio or to switch to other options. Service Mesh is still evolving rapidly, and the future trend should be eBPF + Envoy + WASM. Cilium’s eBPF-based Service Mesh is a new trend (it falls back to Per-Node Proxy mode when using advanced features). It’s expected to hit other Service Mesh of Sidecar mode in terms of cost and delay. As for the log of K8s cluster, we currently use a self-developed system based on gelf protocol, but there are a lot of problems. From the point of view of improving the maintainability and ease of use of the log system, loki is worth exploring. In terms of K8s cluster management, I think the upgrade iteration of the cluster can be done more automatically and reliably. Next year, we can explore more in the direction of multi-cluster management. Pod Service Quality: For non-core services, the amount of requests resources can be appropriately reduced instead of fully reserved (Guaranteed) to improve resource utilization.
