            </div><p>I have dabbled with many niche technologies, and this year, the main ones I explored are
NixOS, window manager i3/hyprland, and Neovim. NixOS, in particular, took me to a whole
new level - I even created an open-source bilingual book<a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-and-flakes-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nixos-and-flakes-book</a> to help
beginners get started. Additionally, I worked on several NixOS-related open-source
projects like <a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-darwin-kickstarter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nix-darwin-kickstarter</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/ryan4yin/nix-config" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ryan4yin/nix-config</a>, which all received
positive feedback.</p>
<p>Based on my experiences with these niche technologies and the frequent questions I receive
(e.g., why did I choose <a href="nixos.org/" rel="">NixOS</a> / <a href="https://github.com/Neovim/Neovim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neovim</a> /<a href="https://flypy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flypy Chinese Input Method</a>? What are their advantages? Can they
really improve productivity?), I would like to briefly share my thoughts on them.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>Summary of My 2021</title><link>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/2021-summary/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Jan 2022 01:40:00 +0800</pubDate><author><name>Ryan Yin</name><uri>https://thiscute.world/en/authors/ryan4yin/</uri></author><guid>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/2021-summary/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

    <a href="#gossip" class="header-mark"></a>Gossip</h2><p>Another year has passed in the twinkling of an eye, and this New year, the global epidemic
has set a new record. After Christmas, the daily increase in the United States has
directly exceeded 1 million. In China, poor management in Xi&rsquo;an has led to hunger.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has been for more than two years.</p>
<p>Back to the point, after leaving from W Company at the beginning of this year, I was very
lucky to join the current company, Mobiuspace, and I was mixed in the process of
integrating into Mobiuspace. However, I am quite satisfied with the overall results, the
current work has been on the right track, but also found a lot of opportunities.</p>]]></description></item><item><title>The End of Another Semester</title><link>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/the-end-of-another-semester/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jun 2017 01:28:45 +0800</pubDate><author><name>Ryan Yin</name><uri>https://thiscute.world/en/authors/ryan4yin/</uri></author><guid>https://thiscute.world/en/posts/the-end-of-another-semester/</guid><description><![CDATA[<div class="featured-image">

<p>Ah, there are still ten days to get rid of the city and return to that reassuring mountain
forest, waiting and anxious, wondering why the remaining ten days are so difficult.</p>
<p>The final review is a mess again. I am really lazy&hellip;</p>
<p>It is so unrealistic for me to have such a big dream that I have finished thousands of
lines of code. I kind of want to accept my fate.</p>]]></description></item></channel></rss>
